Hi, I'm Brian. Welcome to my website.

I am an economist working at the intersection of public policy and innovation. I currently work at [The Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University](thecgo.org), where I have the opportunity to conduct research alongside a talented team of analysts while also managing, training, and mentoring the Center's talented student fellows as the Director of the Student Research Fellowship.

I am deeply interested in the world of energy and environmental economics, where I have researched topics ranging from the effect of institutions on water price and allocation to the impact that wildfire smoke has on solar electricity production. 

I love to spend my free time out hiking and fishing in the mountains of Utah, reading, woodworking, and learning new coding methods and languages. Please take a look around, and feel free to reach out to me via email or any of the social media accounts linked below!
